   <p>
       WALL-E, short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class, is the last robot left on Earth.
       He spends his days tidying up the planet, one piece of garbage at a time. But during 700 years,
       WALL-E has developed a personality, and he's more than a little lonely. Then he spots EVE (Elissa Knight),
       a sleek and shapely probe sent back to Earth on a scanning mission. Smitten WALL-E embarks on his greatest
       adventure yet when he follows EVE across the galaxy.
