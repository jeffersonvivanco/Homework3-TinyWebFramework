# Homework3-TinyWebFramework
A small web framework that allows a developer to write simple web applications. These web applications are built off of and run from node's built-in TCP server.
I created a fan page for my buddy Wall-e using the small web framework that I build. If you would like to see it, please download this
repository and run in terminal the server like --> node src/fansite.js. Enjoy!
